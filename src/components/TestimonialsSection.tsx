The speakers were insightful, the content was relevant, and the overall experience exceeded expectations. It was a great opportunity to learn, connect, and gain valuable perspectives.

We had received mixed reviews about events in general, but we decided to experience it ourselves. I must acknowledge that we received excellent support at every stage—from choosing the right stall to networking opportunities, prime talk time, branding support, and, of course, quality leads. Most importantly, the event opened doors to an entirely new market for our recent launches, which was truly encouraging. Please do let me know once the layout for the next season is out. We would be keen to block our stall in advance. I have no hesitation in recommending ET Tech X for the next season and look forward to being part of it again.",
